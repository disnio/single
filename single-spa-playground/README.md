The single-spa playground is a website that helps you get your code working with <a href="https://single-spa.js.org">single-spa</a>. If you
don't know what single-spa is, check out <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4jqow7NTVg&feature=youtu.be">this intro video</a>.

The playground website is a step-by-step tutorial that helps you configure things in a GUI and then verify that they are working from right
inside the playground. If you have suggestions for improving it, please submit a pull request for file an issue.

## Browser extension

Single-spa also has a <a href="https://github.com/single-spa/single-spa-inspector" target="_blank">browser extension</a> that hooks into your browser's dev tools.
The extension allows you to view and control single-spa applications on any web page that uses single-spa. Feel free to download the extension, in addition
to using the single-spa playground. The two complement each other.
